        <div class="subheading mb-5">Data ScientistðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a fourth year Plant Genetics student at UC Riverside, eager to pursue a career in data science/bioinformatics in the agricultural industry. Growing up, I was deeply fascinated by the human reliance on plants for food, medicine, entertainment, and general survival. It was always a goal of mine to make a positive impact on the world, and after discovering the increasing global demand for food, it became obvious that improving the yield of crops could make a major impact for people around the world. Since then, I have honed my skills through hours of statistical and genomic self study, research in a lab at UCR, and through my internship with Bayer. <br><br>

        For the last three years at UCR, I have been working in a barley evolution lab, with three main computational based projects ranging from analyzing the broad sense heritability and evolutionary trends of performance phenotypes in our barley population to automating the filtration of large amounts of bioinformatic data to locate the position of specific genes in the barley genome using a bash shell script. Also, I worked on a collaboration project with the company, Seed-X, to validate the accuracy of their advanced computer imaging technology to differentiate between two distinct genotypes, phenotypically. Working in this lab has been critical to my understanding of advanced statistical concepts such as principal component analysis (PCA) and Bayesian modeling, as well as genomic concepts such as Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) and Best Linear Unbiased Predictions (BLUPs). Furthermore, I was able to develop my skills in various programming languages such as R, Bash, and Python, which I believe will allow me to seamlessly integrate into a data science role in the agricultural industry. <br><br>

        Additionally, I worked as a Vegetable Seed Intern for Bayer Crop Science, where I was able to gain valuable insight into the manufacturing and production aspect of the seed industry. At Bayer, my main role was to assist in implementing new technology which would allow for a more efficient and cost reduced method of determining seed moisture. Previously, Bayer relied on a moisture analyzer which required a five gram sample of seed to be destroyed in order to determine moisture, which could cost the company up to two hundred fifty dollars per sample depending on the crop. With this new technology, no sample needed to be destroyed, saving time, and perhaps, hundreds of thousands of dollars annually in seed waste. I was responsible for determining the accuracy of the moisture readings of the new machine in comparison to an industry standard oven method, to determine the overall effectiveness of the new machine. Another project I was involved in was a germination experiment comparing the germination rates of tomato seeds in a germination chamber to standard conditions, with the intent to determine whether a germination chamber was necessary to maintain optimal germination requirements. The goal of the germination project was to reduce the amount of labor required when growing the tomato seeds, thus making the process more efficient. All in all, I believe I can contribute immensely to a data science position due to my background in statistical programming and genomic concepts, as well as my experience working in research and industry environments at UCR and at Bayer.
